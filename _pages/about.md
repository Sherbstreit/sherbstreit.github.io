					<h3>Work Experience and Education</h3>
				</header>
				<p> 
					I started my career in veterinary technology. I loved the science behind my work so I got my B.S. in Biochemistry. From there, I started working in animal nutrition R&D at Novus International. During my time there I co-authored two scientific articles that were published in the Journal of Animal Science, validated methods to be presented at animal nutrition conferences, and collaborated with the USDA to validate a method to extract and quantify trypsin inhibitor from soybean meal for use in animal feed. In early 2020 I was given an opportunity by a former colleague to move to MilliporeSigma. This role gave me new skills working in Quality Control. My responsibilites in this role include scheduling for the QC department at my location, introducing new products, creating, updating, and approving documents for the QC group, completing assays per business demand, training team members, and troubleshooting any issues that myself or team members face. Troubleshooting data is what led me to pursue data science. I enjoy statistical anaylsis and investigating data anomalies. I will graduate with my M.S. in Data Science in June 2021. </p>
