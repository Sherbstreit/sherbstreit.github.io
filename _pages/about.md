			<h2>Hello</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My name is Sara Herbstreit. Iâ€™m an experienced Data Scientist specializing in search relevance. I have built our production Learning to Rank (LTR) ML model, tuned our search engine,  created various tools/applications to gain deeper insight into both customer and search engine behaviors, developed process for caching documents to limit load on SAP, and translated our search metadata into 7 additional languages, allowing our customers to search in their native languages and boosting revenue by $850,000 annually. I enjoy ML applications, creating tools/dashboards to monitor processes, ETL and BE work, and all things search-related.
 I am an ambitious and dedicated team player with a proven record of success. I was recognized at my previous employer for excellent cross-team collaboration, and have been recognized in both roles that I have held at my current employer for being a team leader and exhibiting our core values. I have excellent attention to detail and eagerness to continue learning new techniques that allow me to better solution technical issues.

					<h3>Work Experience and Education</h3>
				</header>
				<p> 
					I started my career in veterinary technology. I loved the science behind my work so I got my B.S. in Biochemistry. From there, I started working in animal nutrition R&D at Novus International. During my time there I co-authored a scientific publication that is published in the Journal of Animal Science, validated methods to be presented at animal nutrition conferences, and collaborated with the USDA to validate a method to extract and quantify trypsin inhibitor from soybean meal for use in animal feed. In early 2020 I made the move to MilliporeSigma as a Senior Associate Scientist. This role gave me new skills working in Quality Control. My responsibilites in this role included scheduling for the QC department, introducing new products, creating, updating, and approving documents for the QC group, completing assays per business demand, training team members, and troubleshooting any data issues that myself or team members face. Troubleshooting data is what led me to pursue data science. I enjoy statistical anaylsis and investigating data anomalies. I graduated with my M.S. in Data Science in June 2021.</p>
