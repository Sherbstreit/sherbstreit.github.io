			<h2>Hello</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Iâ€™m an experienced Data Scientist specializing in search relevance. I built a production Learning to Rank (LTR) ML model for a multi-billion dollar e-commerce website, tuned the search engine, created various tools/applications to gain deeper insight into both customer and search engine behaviors, codeveloped process for caching documents to reduce load on ERP, and translated search metadata into 7 additional languages,  boosting revenue by $850,000 annually. I enjoy ML applications, creating tools/dashboards to monitor processes, ETL and BE work, and all things search-related.
<br><br>
<p> I am an ambitious and dedicated team player with a proven record of success. I have been recognized in every professional role I have held, with rewards for cross-team collaboration, leading a team and exhibiting core values. I have excellent attention to detail with a strong drive to continue learning, allowing me to expand my knowledge and determine best practice solutions on technical issues.

					<h3>Work Experience and Education</h3>

I began my career working in animal nutrition R&D at Novus International. During my time there I co-authored a scientific publication in the Journal of Animal Science, validated methods to be presented at animal nutrition conferences, and collaborated with the USDA to validate a new scientific method. In early 2020 I made the move to MilliporeSigma as an Associate Scientist. I was promoted to Senior Associate Scientist at my one-year mark. My responsibilites in this role included scheduling for the QC department, introducing new products, creating, updating, and approving documents for the QC group, completing assays per business demand, training team members, and troubleshooting data and software issues for my team. My passion for data analytics led me to pursue Data Science. I graduated with my M.S. in Data Science in June 2021.</p>
