			<h2>Hello</h2>

		<p>My name is Sara Herbstreit. Iâ€™m an experienced data scientist who enjoys uncovering insights from unstructured and messy data.
 I specialize in machine learning techniques, data visualization, and data wrangling. I currently work as a Data Scientist on a search relevancy team for a high traffic commerce website. My contributions in the role include optimization of results returned from a query, identifying search issues and implementing solutions, and communicating search performance to leadership via interactive visual dashboards. I am an ambitious and dedicated team player with a proven record of success. Excellent attention to detail and incredible organizational skills allow me to multitask well to complete work as efficiently as possible.

					<h3>Work Experience and Education</h3>
				</header>
				<p> 
					I started my career in veterinary technology. I loved the science behind my work so I got my B.S. in Biochemistry. From there, I started working in animal nutrition R&D at Novus International. During my time there I co-authored a scientific publication that is published in the Journal of Animal Science, validated methods to be presented at animal nutrition conferences, and collaborated with the USDA to validate a method to extract and quantify trypsin inhibitor from soybean meal for use in animal feed. In early 2020 I made the move to MilliporeSigma as an Associate Scientist. This role gave me new skills working in Quality Control. My responsibilites in this role included scheduling for the QC department, introducing new products, creating, updating, and approving documents for the QC group, completing assays per business demand, training team members, and troubleshooting any data issues that myself or team members face. Troubleshooting data is what led me to pursue data science. I enjoy statistical anaylsis and investigating data anomalies. I graduated with my M.S. in Data Science in June 2021. After graduation, I was offered my current role as Data Scientist in MilliporeSigma, for the Sigmaaldrich.com search relevancy team. The other data scientist and the supervisor left prior to my start date, pushing me outside of my comfort zone and giving me the opportunity for personal growth. It was very difficult to teach myself the new skills and system knowledge required in this role, but I believe this gave my skillset and confidence a rapid boost. </p>
